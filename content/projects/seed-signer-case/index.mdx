Redesign of the case for the seed signer DIY bitcoin hardware wallet. 

The existing Seed Signer cases use either SLA buttons or no buttons at all. This makes the user experience of interacting with the device challenging.

This case uses buttons which can be printed on an FDM printer, the case is assembled without screws and allows access to both the SD card and the power port on the board.

This is a FOSH project using the CERN-OHL-S v2 licence.
